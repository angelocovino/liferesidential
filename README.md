The index page does not need comments because they are all into styles pages.

### Possible improvement:
With a bit of PHP is possible to generate a lot of pages based on this 'theme'
With PHP is possible to define constants for pieces of the website that will change each time
With a CSS framework is possible to define constants also for the style
Using a bit of JS(JQuery) is possible to complete the slider and other features like the web-responsive menu
